  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> <!-- set date here --></p>

  <p>
    These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Eatto website,
    mobile applications, and related services (the “Services”). By using the Services,
    you agree to be bound by these Terms.
  </p>

    <li>You are responsible for keeping your account credentials secure and for all activity under your account.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Role of Eatto</h2>
  <p>
    Eatto operates as a technology platform that connects customers, restaurants, and independent
    delivery partners. We do not prepare food and are not responsible for the quality or safety of
    meals provided by restaurants.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Orders and Payments</h2>

    <li>When you place an order, you enter into a direct relationship with the selected restaurant and/or delivery partner.</li>
    <li>Prices, delivery fees, and taxes are displayed before you confirm your order.</li>
    <li>Payments are processed through third-party payment providers. Certain orders may not be cancellable once confirmed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Restaurant and Delivery Partners</h2>
  <p>
    Restaurant partners and delivery partners act as independent contractors, not employees or agents of Eatto.
    They are solely responsible for complying with applicable laws, including food safety, licensing,
    and transportation regulations.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Prohibited Activities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Using the Services for any unlawful or fraudulent purpose.</li>
    <li>Interfering with or disrupting the platform or servers.</li>
    <li>Attempting to reverse engineer or copy the platform or mobile applications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, Eatto is not liable for any indirect, incidental, or
    consequential damages, or loss of profits, arising out of or related to your use of the Services.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to the Service and Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update or modify the Services and these Terms from time to time. The latest version will
    be posted on this website, and continued use of the Services after changes take effect constitutes
    your acceptance of the revised Terms.
